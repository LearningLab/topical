Topical
=======

This is a plugin for managing rich topics for WordPress. Topics use both taxonomies and custom post types to create pivot points around which a site can be organized. Think of this as both a drop-in solution for topic pages and a framework for building more complex pathways for user participation.

A topic ties together a post type and a taxonomy:

 - the post type contains background information, a featured image, excerpt and other post-like features
 - the taxonomy (topic) allows us to tie regular posts (or other post types) to the topic

Topical depends on the [Timber][] framework
